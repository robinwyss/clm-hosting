# This file contains an example of using Traefik as a reverse proxy for the CLM Platform APIs.
# By using this configuration you will expose the Storage API and Configuration API on the same port.
# Additionally, the Configuration API is configured using data-driven load balancing, directing complex
# configurations to the a specific powerful server.
